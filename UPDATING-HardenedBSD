[201502011] Changed kernel knobs

Added ``options PAX`` to enable the HardenedBSD framework.
All other PAX_* knob depends on PAX knob.


[20150131] Upgrading from systems before "HBSD: Revert the chacha20 import in full."

After the "HBSD: Revert the chacha20 import in full." commit we lost the compatibility with
the previous version, this means ABI break, and the system is unable to properly boot.
In the background is the removed VM_INHERIT_ZERO flag, which was previously used in libc.

The solution is to install the new world, before you booting to the new kernel.

1. make buildworld kernel
2. IMPORTANT: install world before you reboot
2.1. mergemaster -p && make installworld && mergemaster
3. reboot
4. start in single user mode
5. cd /usr/src
6. make delete-old delete-old-libs

And probably a full ports rebuild required too...
